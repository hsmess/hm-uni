Harry Messenger's submission for the HouseMates code assessment task. <br>

UI built using Tailwind UI. 

Laravel API and routing
React front-end. 

Please forgive lack of tests + typescript, I already spent 3+ hours on this so didn't have time to add the optional requirements to the plan!

Please see comments marked Todo: for enhancements that would be built next with more time. 
Please see comments on routes file about how I would have structured the API should I have had "carte blanche" to design the API.
Instead, I followed the spec exactly and commented how I would change it. 

Please contact me with any questions.
