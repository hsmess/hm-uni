Harry Messenger's submission for the HouseMates code assessment task. <br>

Please see comments marked Todo: for enhancements that would be built next with more time. 
Please see comments on routes file about how I would have structured the API should I have had "carte blanche" to design the API.

Please contact me with any questions.
